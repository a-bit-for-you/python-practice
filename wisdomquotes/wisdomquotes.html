I’d rather have them say, “Go ahead and cry. I’m here to be with you. Fred Rogers</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you&#8217;re feeling sad, remember soon you&#8217;ll forget and move on with life. Your grief is transitory. If you&#8217;re going to let go anyway, why not do so immediately? If you don&#8217;t cling to your grief you won&#8217;t suffer. Life is a river, flow with it. Don&#8217;t hold onto anything. Let go. The Ancient Sage</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Feeling down, lost, confused, angry, jealous are all parts of the human condition. Don&#8217;t fight them. Understand them. Accept them. Love them and go beyond them. Maxime Lagacé</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you’re sad, it’s okay to acknowledge your sadness. If you have pain that leaves you at a loss, it’s okay to talk about it. The reason we have difficulties is that we’re unable to accept the things that can’t be changed. Let them be and see what happens. Haemin Sunim</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Clouds release their sadness by crying until they can cry no more. When they have no tears left, they feel a great weight has been lifted, as heavy as the tears they’ve shed. We can release our sadness into the sky within us. When we feel sad, it’s okay to cry like the clouds. Haemin Sunim</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Listen. Really, really listen if someone opens up to you about their mental health. A response isn&#8217;t always needed, but a compassionate ear is. @RealAnxietyMan</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Most people think that if they move somewhere else and change their environment, everything will change. Usually they end up re-creating the same results they had elsewhere. If you want to change your world, change your beliefs. Neil Strauss</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Whenever sorrow comes, be kind to it. For God has placed a pearl in sorrow’s hand. Rumi</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Sorrow prepares you for joy. It violently sweeps everything out of your house, so that new joy can find space to enter. It shakes the yellow leaves from the bough of your heart, so that fresh, green leaves can grow in their place. Rumi</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Don&#8217;t get lost in your pain, know that one day your pain will become your cure.

If you will be sad about what you don’t have, you will not be happy about what you do have. Leo Tolstoy</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Be grateful to everyone” means that all situations teach you, and often it’s the tough ones that teach you best. Pema Chödrön</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It&#8217;s just hard to see a friend hurt this much. Especially when you can&#8217;t do anything except &#8216;be there.&#8217; I just want to make him stop hurting, but I can&#8217;t. So I just follow him around whenever he wants to show me his world. Stephen Chbosky (The Perks of Being a Wallflower)</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>It’s nice to have things to look forward to! Stephen Chbosky</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Keep busy at something: a busy person never has time to be unhappy. Robert Louis Stevenson</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We must embrace pain and burn it as fuel for our journey. Kenji Miyazawa</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional. M. Kathleen Casey</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The cure for anything is salt water &#8211; sweat, tears, or the sea.

If we understand this then we would stop bewailing every misfortune that occurs. Life is a bargain. You want joy but you can&#8217;t have it without suffering. You must accept the whole package. The Ancient Sage</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Impermanence of everything is a universal constant. No matter what kind of legacy, family, foundation, or business you’ve created, one day it will disappear and no one will remember anything of your life. Justin Kan</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Boredom, anger, sadness, or fear are not ‘yours,’ not personal. They are conditions of the human mind. They come and go. Nothing that comes and goes is you.

But remember you are so much more than an illness. Don&#8217;t give up on yourself. Be kind be well. Bob Morley</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Depression is like a heaviness that you can’t ever escape.

Haemin Sunim</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I’ll never forget how the depression and loneliness felt good and bad at the same time. Henry Rollins</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I don’t know if you’ve ever felt like that. That you wanted to sleep for a thousand years. Or just not exist. Or just not be aware that you do exist. Or something like that. I think wanting that is very morbid, but I want it when I get like this. That’s why I’m trying not to think. I just want it all to stop spinning.
